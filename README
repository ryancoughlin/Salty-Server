# üêü Salty Server - Tide Data API

## Overview

Salty Server is a Node.js API designed to deliver real-time tide information. Utilizing data from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the server provides tide predictions, high and low tide schedules, and related maritime data. This API is particularly useful for mariners, fishermen, and coastal residents or businesses that rely on tide information for operational planning.

## Features

- Fetch tide predictions for a specified date range and location.
- Retrieve highest and lowest tides for upcoming days.
- Serve tide data in a JSON format for easy integration with client applications.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server environment.
- **Express**: Web application framework for routing and middleware functionality.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing tide station data.

## Getting Started
